# :zap: Zip-Archivator
This small script packs all the .step files in the folder where it is located into separate archives for each file.</br>
In addition to the .step file, a .pdf file is added to each archive (for example, Readme.pdf).</br>
The name of each archive is the name of the original .step file.
